I resisted GitHub for as long as I could, but here we are.

For anyone curious, here are some stints/stretches from my life so far, last updated Jan 2023:

- 18 years in Southern California, starting near Disneyland and heading eastward
  - 5 years in high school, after starting 9th grade at age 11 and not feeling ready to leave HS at age 14
    - they let me stay another year on the technicality that I hadn't taken Driver's Ed. Since you had to be 15.
  - 3 years of community college (Citrus and Chaffey, both a bicycle ride from my home as a teen) - pre-eng
- 6 years in the US Navy as an Electronics Technician and Nuclear Reactor Operator
- 8 years (89-97) total at University of Washington getting my undergrad CS degree (long story)
- 5 years (92-97) at Geoworks coding in 8086 assembly language for handheld devices
- 6.5 years (98-05) at Amazon in various roles, including the "role" of selling my 40000 shares at like $80
- 12.5 years at Google, doing lots of stuff, but most notably Grok (their Code Intelligence Platform)
- 2.5 years at Grab Inc, the "Uber+Paypal of Southeast Asia". Got the adventure of a lifetime and PTSD.
- 25 years working part-time on Wyvern, a video game I dreamed of in 1996
- 40 years of playing guitar in different styles/genres
- 6 years sober

I joined Sourcegraph in 2022 and hope to be there for a very long time.
